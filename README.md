## This is still a W.I.P. (Work In Progress).

It's in an unusable state, so if you don't know what you are doing then don't attempt to use it.

## Install
* clone this repo
* cd into it and run `yard install` (I recommend using yarn, npm should also work but I had issues with it before.)

## Run
This package registers its entry command as `anim`.
So you can use it by running `anim` from your terminal. (the npm binaries folder should be in PATH.)
